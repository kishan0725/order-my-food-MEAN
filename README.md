## How to run the application?

  ### Prerequisites:
  - Node LTS version
  - git
  - Angular CLI

  1. Clone the repository in your local machine.
  2. Navigate to `client` directory and run the command `npm i`. Do the same for `server` directory.
  3. Navigate to `server` directory , create a file named `.env`.
  4. Inside the `.env` file, add your mongodb remote string as `DB_CONNECTION` and a secret key (any string) for your jwt token as `SECRET_KEY` (refer this file - https://github.com/kishan0725/order-my-food-MEAN/blob/main/server/.env.example).
  5. Go to your atlas mongodb, create a new collection called `hotels` under the database that you created and copy the contents of the hotel details from here - https://github.com/kishan0725/order-my-food-MEAN/blob/main/client/src/assets/api/data.json and insert it in your `hotels` collection.
  6. Run the command `node server` from the `server` directory and navigate to your localhost url.
  7. Now, you should see the application running in your browser.

## How to make any changes in the UI?

### To make changes and verify it locally
  
  1. Go to `server.js`, uncomment the lines from 10 to 14 and comment out the lines from 18 to 26.
  2. Save the changes and run `node server` under the `server` directory.
  3. Go to `client/src/environments/environment.ts`, comment out the line no. 8 and uncomment line 7.
  4. Do whatever changes you want in the application and save it.
  5. Run the command `ng serve` under the `client` directory.
  6. Open the localhost URL shown in your terminal.
  7. Now, you should see the changes that you made in the application.
  
### To run the changes in the production environment

  1. Once the changes that you made are okay for you, go to `client/src/environments/environment.ts`, uncomment line no. 8 and comment out the line 7.
  2. Save the changes and run the command `ng build --prod` in the `client` directory.
  3. After the successful build, replace the contents of the `public` folder under the `server` directory with the contents of `dist/order-my-food` in the `client` directory.
  4. Go to `server.js`, comment out the lines from 10 to 14 and uncomment the lines from 18 to 26.
  4. Run the command `node server` under the `server` directory.
  5. Open the localhost URL shown in your terminal.
  6. Now, you can verify the changes that you made and deploy it wherever you want (In my case, I deployed it in the Heroku).
